        "In this section, we will delve into the process of acquiring the dataset that has been integral to our analyses – the OLCI data from the Sentinel-3 satellite, part of the Copernicus Dataspace. This segment will guide you through the nuances of accessing this rich dataset, understanding its structure, and efficiently retrieving the data you need for your work.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Overview**  \n",
        "Copernicus Data Space is a cornerstone of the European Union's Earth observation program, providing a wealth of data from the Sentinel satellites. Aimed at monitoring the Earth's environment, it supports applications in areas like climate change, disaster response, and urban planning.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Features**\n",
        "- **Diverse Datasets**: Offers imagery, atmospheric measurements, and climate indicators.\n",
        "- **Accessibility**: Data is freely accessible, fostering open science and research.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Resources**  \n",
        "For more information and data access, visit the [Copernicus Dataspace](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu).\n",

        "1. **Area and Time Specification:** Initially, we define the geographical scope and the specific time frame of interest. This precise specification allows us to target our data retrieval effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Retrieving Metadata from Copernicus Dataspace:** Once the area and time parameters are set, we proceed to fetch a list of relevant file names from Copernicus Dataspace.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Optional 1: Fetching Raw Data from Copernicus Dataspace given date and time:** With the metadata saved, we then access the Copernicus Dataspace to retrieve the raw data. You are able to see its preview at [Copernicus Dataspace browser](https://browser.dataspace.copernicus.eu/) with filename you are interested in (to see if it is cloud free, etc), before initiating the download.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Optional 2: Browsing first and download the raw data:**  You can also go to the [Copernicus Dataspace browser](https://browser.dataspace.copernicus.eu/) first and select you images. With filenames you are interested, you can initiate the download.\n",

        "4. **Optional 1: Fetching Raw Data from Copernicus Dataspace given date and time:** With the metadata saved, we then access the Copernicus Dataspace to retrieve the raw data.
